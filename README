ðŸŒŸ *Empowering Conversations with AI Chatbots*  

ðŸ”— The journey of building an intelligent chatbot combines creativity, data preprocessing, and cutting-edge technology. Through a mix of data exploration, NLP techniques, and deep learning models, my teammates and I.

ðŸ›  *Key highlights*:
- *Data Preparation*: Loaded and cleaned data from various datasets:  
  - IT Helpdesk Chatbot Dataset: /kaggle/input/it-helpdesk-chatbot-dataset/intents.json  
  - Simple Chatbot Dataset: /kaggle/input/simple-chatbot-dataset/intents.json  
  - Computer Science Theory QA Dataset: /kaggle/input/computer-science-theory-qa-dataset/intents.json  
  - Chatbot Dataset by Mohammad Nourullahi: /kaggle/input/d/mohammadnourullahi/chatbot-dataset/intents.json  
  - Star Wars Chatbot Dataset: /kaggle/input/star-wars-chat-bot/starwarsintents.json  
  Applied regex for preprocessing, tokenization, and lemmatization to optimize the dataset for linguistic accuracy.  
- *Data Exploration*: Utilized pandas for detailed dataset analysis to uncover patterns and insights.  
- *Visualization*: Used matplotlib and seaborn to highlight data distributions and guide improvements.  
- *Model Design*: Developed a TensorFlow/Keras model using embedding layers, LSTMs, and dense layers to interpret and respond to user intent effectively.  
- *Deployment*: Built the chatbot interface with Streamlit to offer a seamless user experience.  

ðŸ’¡ This project stands out for its adaptabilityâ€”cleaning patterns, removing duplicates, and applying NLP techniques for semantic understanding. Integrating Streamlit ensures accessibility, moving beyond a backend solution.  

ðŸ”‘ *Technologies used*: TensorFlow, spaCy, Streamlit, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
