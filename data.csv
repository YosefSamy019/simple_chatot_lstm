255,shakespeare_poems,Read me a poem by Shakespeare.,"Certainly! Here's a beautiful poem by William Shakespeare:

Over hill, over dale,
Thorough bush, thorough brier,
Over park, over pale,
Thorough flood, thorough fire!
I do wander everywhere,
Swifter than the moon's sphere;
And I serve the Fairy Queen,
To dew her orbs upon the green;
The cowslips tall her pensioners be;
In their gold coats spots you see;
Those be rubies, fairy favours;
In those freckles live their savours;
I must go seek some dewdrops here,
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear."
256,shakespeare_poems,Share a Shakespearean poem with me.,"Certainly! Here's a beautiful poem by William Shakespeare:

Over hill, over dale,
Thorough bush, thorough brier,
Over park, over pale,
Thorough flood, thorough fire!
I do wander everywhere,
Swifter than the moon's sphere;
And I serve the Fairy Queen,
To dew her orbs upon the green;
The cowslips tall her pensioners be;
In their gold coats spots you see;
Those be rubies, fairy favours;
In those freckles live their savours;
I must go seek some dewdrops here,
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear."

403,abstraction,Explain data abstraction.,"Data abstraction is a technique used in computer programming to separate the implementation details of a data type from its interface, allowing the implementation to be changed without affecting the code that uses it. This is often achieved through the use of abstract data types (ADTs), which are defined by the operations they support rather than their specific implementation, or through the use of interfaces and classes in object-oriented programming languages. Data abstraction helps to reduce the complexity of software systems by allowing code to be written in a modular and flexible way and by hiding the underlying details of data types from the user."

It occurs when the code does not conform to the rules of the programming language's syntax.

Syntax errors are usually detected by a compiler or interpreter when the code is being compiled or executed, and they can prevent the code from running correctly.

412,testing,What is software testing?,"Software testing is the process of evaluating a software system or its component(s) with the intent of finding whether it satisfies the specified requirements or not. Software testing can be done manually or with the use of automated tools. It helps to identify errors, gaps, or missing requirements in the software. There are various types of software testing, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing, each of which has a specific focus and purpose. Software testing is an important part of the software development process because it helps to ensure that the software is of high quality and fit for its intended purpose."
413,datastructure,How do you explain a data structure?,"A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. Some common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Data structures are an important part of computer science because they provide a means of organizing and storing data in a way that is efficient and easy to use. They are used in many areas of computing, including operating systems, database management systems, and computer networking."
414,bst,Explain what a binary search tree is.,"A binary search tree (BST) is a tree-based data structure in which each node has at most two children and all the nodes in the left subtree of a node have a value less than the node's value, and all the nodes in the right subtree have a value greater than the node's value. This structure allows for fast searching, insertion, and deletion of elements. Binary search trees are often used to store data that needs to be retrieved quickly, such as in the implementation of a dictionary or set data type. They are also used in many other applications, such as for storing and organizing data in databases and for optimizing search algorithms."
415,dynamic,What are dynamic data structures?,"Dynamic data structures are data structures that can change in size during the execution of a program. This is in contrast to static data structures, which have a fixed size that is determined when the program is compiled. Dynamic data structures are often implemented using pointers, which allow them to allocate and deallocate memory as needed. Some common dynamic data structures include linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees. Dynamic data structures are useful because they can adapt to changing data needs and do not require the programmer to know the size of the data in advance. However, they can be more complex to implement and may have slower performance than static data structures in some cases."
416,dll,Can you explain doubly linked list?,"A doubly linked list is a linear data structure in which each element is a node that contains a value and two pointers. One pointer points to the previous element in the list, and the other pointer points to the next element in the list. This allows for traversal of the list in both directions. Doubly linked lists are often used when it is necessary to efficiently insert or delete elements from the middle of the list, as they allow for easy manipulation of the pointers. They can also be used to implement stacks and queues. However, doubly linked lists require more memory than some other data structures because each node requires two pointers, rather than just one."
417,lr,What is logistic regression?,"In machine learning, logistic regression is a type of algorithm used to classify data points into one of two categories. It is a supervised learning algorithm, meaning it requires a labeled dataset to train on. Given a set of input features and a label indicating which category the data point belongs to, the algorithm learns a function that maps the input features to the label. Once trained, the model can be used to predict the label for new, unseen data points. Logistic regression is a popular choice for binary classification problems because it is relatively simple to implement and interpret, and it tends to perform well on a wide range of datasets. It uses sigmoid function as an activation function"
418,dt,Describe decision tree,"A decision tree is a type of machine learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression tasks. It is a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, represented graphically. Each internal node of the tree represents a decision based on the value of a feature, and each leaf node represents a predicted outcome. The tree is constructed by learning from a training dataset, which includes input features and labels indicating the correct category for each data point. To make a prediction for a new, unseen data point, the algorithm follows the path down the tree, making decisions based on the values of the input features and ultimately arriving at a prediction for the label. Decision trees are widely used because they are easy to understand and interpret, and they can handle both categorical and numerical data."
419,cm,Explain confusion matrix,"A confusion matrix is a table that is used to evaluate the performance of a classification algorithm. It is a summary of the predictions made by the algorithm, with the actual class labels on one axis and the predicted class labels on the other. The table shows the number of times each combination of actual and predicted labels occurred. The confusion matrix can be used to calculate various performance metrics, such as precision, recall, and accuracy, which give an indication of how well the algorithm is able to predict the correct class labels. It is a useful tool for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of a classification algorithm and for identifying areas for improvement."
420,bias,What is bias in data science?,"Bias in data science refers to the systematic error or deviation of a model or algorithm from the true underlying relationship it is attempting to model. Bias can occur for a variety of reasons, such as a poorly chosen model, incomplete or unrepresentative data, or incorrect assumptions about the data. Bias can have negative consequences, such as leading to inaccurate or unfair predictions or decisions. For example, a biased model might consistently overestimate or underestimate the value of a certain variable, or it might unfairly favor certain groups over others. It is important to identify and address bias in data science to ensure that models and algorithms are accurate and fair. This can be done through careful data selection and preprocessing, model selection and evaluation, and ongoing monitoring and testing."
421,dr,What is dimensionality reduction?,"Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of dimensions (features) in a dataset while preserving as much of the information as possible. It is often used as a preprocessing step before applying machine learning algorithms, as it can help to simplify data, reduce computational complexity, and improve the performance of the model. There are several methods for dimensionality reduction, including feature selection, feature extraction, and manifold learning. Dimensionality reduction is an important tool for working with high-dimensional datasets, which can be difficult to analyze and visualize, and can help to reduce overfitting, improve the interpretability of the results, and reduce the computational cost of training the model."
422,dbms,What is DBMS?,"A database management system (DBMS) is a software application that is used to create, manage, and manipulate databases. A database is a collection of data that is organized in a specific way, allowing for efficient retrieval and manipulation of the data. A DBMS provides a set of tools and interfaces that allow users to create, modify, and query the database, as well as to control access to the data and maintain the integrity and consistency of the data. DBMSs are widely used in a variety of applications, including financial systems, customer relationship management systems, and online shopping systems. They are an essential component of many business and organization systems, as they allow for the efficient storage and management of large amounts of data."
423,normal,Explain normalization and de-normalization in databases.,"Normalization is the process of organizing a database in a way that minimizes redundancy and dependency. It involves breaking down a large table into smaller, more specialized tables, and establishing relationships between them using foreign keys. The goal of normalization is to reduce data redundancy, improve data integrity, and make it easier to modify the database structure. De-normalization is the process of reversing normalization, by combining tables or adding redundant data back into the database. It is often done to improve the performance of certain types of queries, at the expense of increased redundancy and a more complex database structure. De-normalization is used in cases where the benefits of faster query performance outweigh the drawbacks of increased data redundancy and complexity. Both normalization and de-normalization are important concepts in database design, and the appropriate approach depends on the specific requirements and goals of the database."
424,bcnf,What is BCNF? How it is different from 3NF?,"BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) is a normal form in database design that is used to ensure that a database is free of certain types of anomalies and dependency issues. It requires that every determinant in the database be a candidate key, which is a set of attributes that uniquely identifies each row in a table. BCNF is more restrictive than 3NF (Third Normal Form), which only requires that the database be in 2NF (Second Normal Form) and that all the non-key attributes in the database be fully dependent on the primary key. BCNF can result in a more complex database structure, with more tables and foreign keys, but it can help to ensure that the database is well-organized and easy to maintain and modify."
425,relation,What is a degree of relation in DBMS?,"The degree of a relation in a database management system (DBMS) refers to the number of attributes it has. A relation with a single attribute is called a unary relation, a relation with two attributes is called a binary relation, and a relation with three or more attributes is called a ternary or higher-order relation. The degree of a relation is an important concept in database design, as it affects the structure and organization of the data."
426,ai,Give an explanation on the difference between strong AI and weak AI?,"Strong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence, refers to artificial intelligence systems that have the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can. In other words, strong AI systems have a general and flexible intelligence that allows them to adapt to and learn new tasks, rather than being specifically designed for a single task or set of tasks. Weak AI, also known as artificial narrow intelligence, refers to artificial intelligence systems that are designed for a specific task or set of tasks. These systems are not capable of adapting to new tasks or learning new skills. They are often designed to perform a specific function, such as recognizing faces in images or playing a game like chess. In summary, the main difference between strong AI and weak AI is the scope and flexibility of their intelligence. Strong AI systems are capable of adapting to and learning new tasks, while weak AI systems are limited to the specific tasks they were designed for."
427,expert,Define an expert system in AI?,"An expert system is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) system that is designed to mimic the decision-making abilities of a human expert in a particular domain. Expert systems are often used in fields where specialized knowledge is required, such as medicine, engineering, and finance. Expert systems typically consist of a knowledge base, which contains information and rules about the domain, and an inference engine, which uses the knowledge base to draw conclusions and make recommendations. The knowledge base is usually created by experts in the field, who input their knowledge and expertise into the system. The inference engine uses this knowledge to make decisions and provide recommendations based on a set of input data."
428,rnn,What Are recurrent neural networks?,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a type of artificial neural network that are designed to process sequential data. They are particularly useful for tasks that involve processing data with a temporal dimension, such as language translation, speech recognition, and time series prediction. RNNs are composed of units called neurons, which are connected together in a network and are able to pass information from one unit to the next. Unlike traditional neural networks, which process data in a feedforward manner, RNNs have feedback connections, which allow them to retain information from previous time steps and use it to process the current time step. This makes them well-suited for tasks that involve processing data with a temporal dimension, as they are able to consider the context and dependencies between time steps."
429,supervised,What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?,"Supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning are two categories of machine learning algorithms that are used to train models on data. In supervised machine learning, the training data includes both input features and labeled output values. The goal of supervised learning is to train a model to make predictions about the output values given the input features. This requires the availability of labeled data, which can be used to train the model and evaluate its performance. Examples of supervised learning tasks include classification, regression, and prediction. In unsupervised machine learning, the training data includes only input features and no labeled output values. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find patterns and relationships in the data, rather than making predictions about specific output values. This requires the model to learn from the data itself, without the guidance of labeled outputs. Examples of unsupervised learning tasks include clustering and dimensionality reduction. In summary, the main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is the availability of labeled data. Supervised learning requires labeled data, while unsupervised learning does not."
430,hyperparameters,What do you understand by the hyperparameter?,"Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before training a machine learning model. They are not learned from the training data, but rather are set manually by the developer. Hyperparameters control the behavior and performance of the model, and can have a significant impact on the accuracy and generalization of the model. Examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate for gradient descent, the regularization coefficient, the number of hidden units in a neural network, and the depth of a decision tree. These hyperparameters are set before training the model, and their values are used to control the training process and the resulting model. Hyperparameter optimization is the process of finding the best values for the hyperparameters of a machine learning model. This can be done manually, through trial and error, or using automated methods such as grid search or random search. Hyperparameter optimization is an important step in the process of developing a machine learning model, as it can have a significant impact on the performance of the model."
431,bn,What are bayesian networks?,"Bayesian networks are a type of probabilistic graphical model that represent the dependencies between different variables. They are used to represent and reason about uncertain or probabilistic information. Bayesian networks consist of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), in which the nodes represent variables and the edges represent the dependencies between the variables. The variables can be binary (e.g., true/false) or continuous (e.g., real numbers). Each variable is associated with a probability distribution that describes its possible values and the likelihood of each value occurring. The edges in the graph represent the relationships between the variables, and the probabilities in the distributions are used to capture the dependencies between the variables. Bayesian networks are useful for representing complex systems with many variables and dependencies, and can be used to make predictions about the values of variables given the values of other variables. They are commonly used in fields such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analysis."
432,encryption,What is encryption?,"Encryption is the process of converting plain text or data into a coded or unreadable form, often to prevent unauthorized access or tampering. It is commonly used to secure data transmission over the internet or to protect sensitive information stored in databases or other digital systems. There are two types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric. In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, while in asymmetric encryption, a pair of keys (public and private) is used, with one key used for encryption and the other for decryption. Common encryption algorithms include AES, RSA, and DES."

John Ames is a preacher, the son of a preacher and the grandson (both maternal and paternal) of preachers. It’s 1956 in Gilead, Iowa, towards the end of the Reverend Ames’s life, and he is absorbed in recording his family’s story, a legacy for the young son he will never see grow up. Haunted by his grandfather’s presence, John tells of the rift between his grandfather and his father: the elder, an angry visionary who fought for the abolitionist cause, and his son, an ardent pacifist. He is troubled, too, by his prodigal namesake, Jack (John Ames) Boughton, his best friend’s lost son who returns to Gilead searching for forgiveness and redemption. Told in John Ames’s joyous, rambling voice that finds beauty, humour and truth in the smallest of life’s details, Gilead is a song of celebration and acceptance of the best and the worst the world has to offer. At its heart is a tale of the sacred bonds between fathers and sons, pitch-perfect in style and story, set to dazzle critics and readers alike.', 'Rate': 3.85}"

Proud, grateful, and longing to be American, the Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant, gritty, soulful, and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. For sixty years they have been left alone, neglected and half-forgotten in a backwater of history. Now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry them off into the unknown. But homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. He and his half-Tlingit partner, Berko Shemets, can\'t catch a break in any of their outstanding cases. Landsman\'s new supervisor is the love of his life—and also his worst nightmare. And in the cheap hotel where he has washed up, someone has just committed a murder—right under Landsman\'s nose. Out of habit, obligation, and a mysterious sense that it somehow offers him a shot at redeeming himself, Landsman begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy. But when word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, Landsman soon finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, hopefulness, evil, and salvation that are his heritage—and with the unfinished business of his marriage to Bina Gelbfish, the one person who understands his darkest fears. At once a gripping whodunit, a love story, an homage to 1940s noir, and an exploration of the mysteries of exile and redemption, The Yiddish Policemen\'s Union is a novel only Michael Chabon could have written.', 'Rate': 3.7}"

For sixty years they have been left alone, neglected and half-forgotten in a backwater of history. Now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry them off into the unknown.

Grant – a man who managed to end the Civil War on a note of grace, serve two terms as president, write one of the most successful military memoirs in American literature, and is today remembered as a brilliant general but a failed president. Ulysses S. Grant was the first officer since George Washington to become a four–star general in the United States Army, and the only president between Andrew Jackson and Woodrow Wilson to serve eight consecutive years in the White House. In this succinct and vivid biography, Michael Korda considers Grant's character and reconciles the conflicting evaluations of his leadership abilities. Grant's life played out as a true Horatio Alger story. Despite his humble background as the son of a tanner in Ohio, his lack of early success in the army, and assorted failed business ventures, his unwavering determination propelled him through the ranks of military leadership and into the presidency. But while the general's tenacity and steadfastness contributed to his success on the battlefield, it both aided and crippled his effectiveness in the White House. Assessing Grant both within the context of his time and in contrast to more recent American leaders, Korda casts a benevolent eye on Grant's presidency while at the same time conceding his weaknesses. He suggests that though the general's second term ended in financial and political scandals, the fact remains that for eight years Grant exerted a calming influence on a country that had only just emerged from a horrendous civil war.

Situating Jefferson within the context of America's evolution and tracing his legacy over the past two hundred years, Hitchens brings the character of Jefferson to life as a man of his time and also as a symbolic figure beyond it. Conflicted by power, Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence and acted as Minister to France yet yearned for a quieter career in the Virginia legislature. Predicting that slavery would shape the future of America's development, this professed proponent of emancipation elided the issue in the Declaration and continued to own human property. An eloquent writer, he was an awkward public speaker; a reluctant candidate, he left an indelible presidential legacy. Jefferson's statesmanship enabled him to negotiate the Louisiana Purchase with France, doubling the size of the nation, and he authorized the Lewis and Clark expedition, opening up the American frontier for exploration and settlement. Hitchens also analyzes Jefferson's handling of the Barbary War, a lesser-known chapter of his political career, when his attempt to end the kidnapping and bribery of Americans by the Barbary states, and the subsequent war with Tripoli, led to the building of the U.S. navy and the fortification of America's reputation regarding national defense. In the background of this sophisticated analysis is a large historical drama: the fledgling nation's struggle for independence, formed in the crucible of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, and, in its shadow, the deformation of that struggle in the excesses of the French Revolution.

This artful portrait of a formative figure and a turbulent era poses a challenge to anyone interested in American history -- or in the ambiguities of human nature."", 'Rate': 3.92}"

There is more historical data on his life than on that of the founder of any other major faith, and yet his story is little known. Karen Armstrong's immaculately researched new biography of Muhammad will enable readers to understand the true origins and spirituality of a faith that is all too often misrepresented as cruel, intolerant, and inherently violent. An acclaimed authority on religious and spiritual issues, Armstrong offers a balanced, in-depth portrait, revealing the man at the heart of Islam by dismantling centuries of misconceptions. Armstrong demonstrates that Muhammad's life—a pivot point in history—has genuine relevance to the global crises we face today."", 'Rate': 4.04}"

Foster shows how easy and gratifying it is to unlock those hidden truths, and to discover a world where a road leads to a quest; a shared meal may signify a communion; and rain, whether cleansing or destructive, is never just rain.

Now, in Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time, Marcus Borg addresses the yearnings of those who want a fully contemporary faith that welcomes rather than oppresses our critical intelligence and openness to the best of historical scholarship. Borg shows how a rigorous examination of historical findings can lead to a new faith in Christ, one that is critical and, at the same time, sustaining. ""Believing in Jesus does not mean believing doctrines about him,"" Borg writes. ""Rather, it means to give one\'s heart, one\'s self at its deepest level, to . . . the living Lord."" Drawing on his own journey from a naive, unquestioning belief in Christ through collegiate skepticism to a mature and contemporary Christian faith, Borg illustrates how an understanding of the historical Jesus can actually lead to a more authentic Christian life—one not rooted in creeds or dogma, but in a life of spiritual challenge, compassion, and community. In straightforward, accessible prose, Borg looks at the major findings of modern Jesus scholarship from the perspective of faith, bringing alive the many levels of Jesus\' character: spirit person, teacher of alternative wisdom, social prophet, and movement founder. He also reexamines the major stories of the Old Testament vital to an authentic understanding of Jesus, showing how an enriched understanding of these stories can uncover new truths and new pathways to faith. For questioning believers, doubters, and reluctant unbelievers alike, Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time frees our understanding of Jesus\' life and message from popular misconceptions and outlines the way to a sound and contemporary faith: ""For ultimately, Jesus is not simply a figure of the past, but a figure of the present.

Answering this modern dilemma, acclaimed author Marcus Borg reveals how it is possible to reconcile the Bible with both a scientific and critical way of thinking and our deepest spiritual needs, leading to a contemporary yet grounded experience of the sacred texts. This seminal book shows you how to read the Bible as it should be examined—in an approach the author calls ""historical-metaphorical.""

The author argues that the conventional way of seeing the Bible\'s origin, authority, and interpretation has become unpersuasive to millions of people in our time, and that we need a fresh way of encountering the Bible that takes the texts seriously but not literally, even as it takes seriously who we have become. Borg traces his personal spiritual journey, describing for readers how he moved from an unquestioning childhood belief in the biblical stories to a more powerful and dynamic relationship with the Bible as a sacred text brimming with meaning and guidance.

They are found in all complex living things, and in that sense, they are fundamental for driving complex life on the planet. But there is much more to them than that. Mitochondria have their own DNA, with their own small collection of genes, separate from those in the cell nucleus. It is thought that they were once bacteria living independent lives. Their enslavement within the larger cell was a turning point in the evolution of life, enabling the development of complex organisms and, closely related, the origin of two sexes. Unlike the DNA in the nucleus, mitochondrial DNA is passed down exclusively (or almost exclusively) via the female line. That's why it has been used by some researchers to trace human ancestry daughter-to-mother, to 'Mitochondrial Eve'. Mitochondria give us important information about our evolutionary history. And that's not all. Mitochondrial genes mutate much faster than those in the nucleus because of the free radicals produced in their energy-generating role. This high mutation rate lies behind our ageing and certain congenital diseases. The latest research suggests that mitochondria play a key role in degenerative diseases such as cancer, through their involvement in precipitating cell suicide. Mitochondria, then, are pivotal in power, sex, and suicide. In this fascinating and thought-provoking book, Nick Lane brings together the latest research findings in this exciting field to show how our growing understanding of mitochondria is shedding light on how complex life evolved, why sex arose (why don't we just bud?), and why we age and die. This understanding is of fundamental importance, both in understanding how we and all other complex life came to be, but also in order to be able to control our own illnesses, and delay our degeneration and death.

Among this year\'s selections: In ""The Made-to-Order Savior,"" Lisa Belkin spotlights two desperate families seeking an unprecedented cure by a medically and ethically unprecedented means -- creating a genetically matched child. Margaret Talbot\'s ""A Desire to Duplicate"" reveals that the first human clone may very likely come from an entirely unexpected source, and sooner than we think. Michael Specter reports on the shock waves rippling through the field of neuroscience following the revolutionary discovery that adult brain cells might in fact regenerate (""Rethinking the Brain""). Christopher Dickey\'s ""I Love My Glow Bunny"" recounts with sly humor a peculiar episode in which genetic engineering and artistic culture collide. Natalie Angier draws an insightful contrast between suicide terrorists and rescue workers who risk their lives, and finds that sympathy and altruism have a definite place in the evolution of human nature, David Berlinski\'s ""What Brings a World into Being?"" ponders the idea of biology and physics as essentially digital technologies, exploring the mysteries encoded in the universe\'s smallest units, be they cells or quanta. Nicholas Wade shows how one of the most controversial books of the year, The Skeptical Environmentalist, by former Greenpeace member and self-described leftist Bjorn Lomborg, debunks some of the most cherished tenets of the environmental movement, suggesting that things are perhaps not as bad as we\'ve been led to believe. And as a counterpoint, Darcy Frey\'s profile of George Divoky reveals a dedicated researcher whose love of birds and mystery leads to some sobering discoveries about global warming and forcefully reminds us of the unsung heroes of science: those who put in long hours, fill in small details, and take great trouble. In the end, the unanswered questions are what sustain scientific inquiry, open new frontiers of knowledge, and lead to new technologies and medical treatments. The Best American Science Writing 2002 is a series of exciting reports from science\'s front lines, where what we don\'t know is every bit as important as what we know.', 'Rate': 3.88}, {'Book': 'How to Build a Time Machine', 'Feedback': ""Is time travel really possible?

Brian Greene has made the mysteries of space and time accessible to millions with his acclaimed writings and award-winning TV series. Now he reveals a world more beautiful and bizarre than we could have imagined, where 'dark matter' reigns, space warps and wiggles through eleven dimensions, minute particles dance, fizz and teleport across vast distances, everything is made of vibrating strings and, like an ant on a lily-pad, we may be floating on a sliver of spacetime. Revealing new layers of reality that lie just beneath the surface of our everyday lives, this grand tour of the universe will make you look at the world in a completely new way.

They are found in all complex living things, and in that sense, they are fundamental for driving complex life on the planet. But there is much more to them than that. Mitochondria have their own DNA, with their own small collection of genes, separate from those in the cell nucleus. It is thought that they were once bacteria living independent lives. Their enslavement within the larger cell was a turning point in the evolution of life, enabling the development of complex organisms and, closely related, the origin of two sexes. Unlike the DNA in the nucleus, mitochondrial DNA is passed down exclusively (or almost exclusively) via the female line. That's why it has been used by some researchers to trace human ancestry daughter-to-mother, to 'Mitochondrial Eve'. Mitochondria give us important information about our evolutionary history. And that's not all. Mitochondrial genes mutate much faster than those in the nucleus because of the free radicals produced in their energy-generating role. This high mutation rate lies behind our ageing and certain congenital diseases. The latest research suggests that mitochondria play a key role in degenerative diseases such as cancer, through their involvement in precipitating cell suicide. Mitochondria, then, are pivotal in power, sex, and suicide. In this fascinating and thought-provoking book, Nick Lane brings together the latest research findings in this exciting field to show how our growing understanding of mitochondria is shedding light on how complex life evolved, why sex arose (why don't we just bud?), and why we age and die. This understanding is of fundamental importance, both in understanding how we and all other complex life came to be, but also in order to be able to control our own illnesses, and delay our degeneration and death.

Feynman (1918–1988) was widely recognized as the most creative physicist of the post–World War II period. His career was extraordinarily expansive. From his contributions to the development of the atomic bomb a Los Alamos during World War II to his work in quantum electrodynamics, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1965, Feynman was celebrated for his brilliant and irreverent approach to physics.It was Feynman's outrageous and scintillating method of teaching that earned him legendary status among students and professors of physics. From 1961–1963, Feynman, at the California Institute of Technology, delivered a series of lectures that revolutionized the teaching of physics around the world. Six Easy Pieces, taken from the famous Lectures on Physics, represents the most accessible material from this series. In these six chapters, Feynman introduces the general reader to the following topics: atoms, basic physics, the relationship of physics to other topics, energy, gravitation, and quantum force. With his dazzling and inimitable wit, Feynman presents each discussion without equations or technical jargon.Readers will remember how—using ice water and rubber—Feynman demonstrated with stunning simplicity to a nationally televised audience the physics of the 1986 Challenger disaster. It is precisely this ability—the clear and direct illustration of complex theories—that made Richard Feynman one of the most distinguished educators in the world. Filled with wonderful examples and clever illustrations, Six Easy Pieces is the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of physics by one of the most admired and accessible scientists of our time."", 'Rate': 4.2}, {'Book': 'Genetics and the Origin of Species', 'Feedback': 'Featuring an introduction by Stephen Jay Gould, ""Genetics and the Origin of Species"" presents the first edition of Dobzhansky\'s groundbreaking and now classic inquiry into what has emerged as the most important single area of scientific inquiry in the twentieth century: biological theory of evolution.

Focusing on ""disruptive technology"" -- the Honda Super Cub, Intel\'s 8088 processor, or the hydraulic excavator, for example -- Christensen shows why most companies miss ""the next great wave."" Whether in electronics or retailing, a successful company with established products will get pushed aside unless managers know when to abandon traditional business practices. Using the lessons of successes and failures from leading companies, The Innovator\'s Dilemma presents a set of rules for capitalizing on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation. Find out: When it is right not to listen to customers. When to invest in developing lower-performance products that promise lower margins. When to pursue small markets at the expense of seemingly larger and more lucrative ones.

So write Jim Collins and Jerry Porras in this groundbreaking book that shatters myths, provides new insights, and gives practical guidance to those who would like to build landmark companies that stand the test of time. Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Collins and Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies -- they have an average age of nearly one hundred years and have outperformed the general stock market by a factor of fifteen since 1926 -- and studied each company in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day -- as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: ""What makes the truly exceptional companies different from other companies?"" What separates General Electric, 3M, Merck, Wal-Mart, Hewlett-Packard, Walt Disney, and Philip Morris from their rivals? How, for example, did Procter & Gamble, which began life substantially behind rival Colgate, eventually prevail as the premier institution in its industry?

By the time Goethe\'s Theory of Colours appeared in 1810, the wavelength theory of light and color had been firmly established. To Goethe, the theory was the result of mistaking an incidental result for an elemental principle. Far from pretending to a knowledge of physics, he insisted that such knowledge was an actual hindrance to understanding. He based his conclusions exclusively upon exhaustive personal observation of the phenomena of color. Of his own theory, Goethe was supremely confident: ""From the philosopher, we believe we merit thanks for having traced the phenomena of colours to their first sources, to the circumstances under which they appear and are, and beyond which no further explanation respecting them is possible."" Goethe\'s scientific conclusions have, of course, long since been thoroughly demolished, but the intelligent reader of today may enjoy this work on quite different grounds: for the beauty and sweep of his conjectures regarding the connection between color and philosophical ideas; for an insight into early nineteenth-century beliefs and modes of thought; and for the flavor of life in Europe just after the American and French Revolutions. The book does not have to be studied to be appreciated. Goethe\'s subjective theory of colors permits him to speak most persuasively of color harmony and aesthetics. In some readers these notions will evoke a positive response on their merits. Others may regard them as pure fantasy, but savor the grace and style of their exposition. The work may also be read as an accurate guide to the study of color phenomena. Goethe\'s conclusions have been repudiated, but no one quarrels with his reporting of the facts to be observed. With simple objects--vessels, prisms, lenses, and the like--the reader will be led through a demonstration course not only in subjectively produced colors, but also in the observable physical phenomena of color.

Frey urges writers to aim high-not to try to write a good-enough-to-get-published mystery, but a damn good mystery. A damn good mystery is first a dramatic novel, Frey insists-a dramatic novel with living, breathing characters-and he shows his readers how to create a living, breathing, believable character who will be clever and resourceful, willful and resolute, and will be what Frey calls ""the author of the plot behind the plot."" Frey then shows, in his well-known, entertaining, and accessible (and often humorous) style , how the characters-the entire ensemble, including the murderer, the detective, the authorities, the victims, the suspects, the witnesses and the bystanders-create a complete and coherent world. Exploring both the on-stage action and the behind-the-scenes intrigue, Frey shows prospective writers how to build a fleshed-out, believable, and logical world. He shows them exactly which parts of that world show up in the pages of a damn good mystery-and which parts are held back just long enough to keep the reader guessing. This is an indispensable step-by-step guide for anyone who\'s ever dreamed of writing a damn good mystery.', 'Rate': 3.97}, {'Book': 'Better Than Sex', 'Feedback': 'An odyssey through the American electoral process provides insights and observations on the 1992 presidential campaign', 'Rate': 3.76}]"

But Wolfe goes even further to unravel the large-scale cover-up behind the case.

In John Paul Wiggin-the future father of Ender -they believe they may have found their man. Or boy.

And I expected to cause a shock.""--Jean-Jacques Pauvert, from the Introduction When Story of O was first published in 1954 in Paris by Jean-Jacques Pauvert, it narrowly escaped censorship by the Department of the Interior and eventually became the most widely translated French novel in the world. It describes in cool, elegant language the experiences of a young woman as she willingly enters a dark maze of perverse sexual practices within a clandestine amoral society. Revelling in pure fantasy, its theme is total submission through love to excesses of sadism and masochism, and the bond of ""ownership."" Now Doris Kloster, a photographer specializing in issues of women\'s sexuality and power, has realized a long-standing dream. She has created a photographic representation of one of the most famous and controversial erotic novels ever published. The result is another sensation. The Illustrated Story of O presents over 50 superb images which mirror perfectly the intense eroticism of the novel. Shooting entirely in Paris and its environs, Doris Kloster has succeeded in matching characters, locations, costumes and props to the original descriptions. And each magnificent color photograph is accompanied by a short extract from the novel. In addition, there is a Preface from Doris Kloster herself and an Introduction from Jean-Jacques Pauvert, the original publisher of the novel. The Illustrated Story of O presents a rich visual feast that will delight fans of Doris Kloster\'s work, and appeal strongly to connoisseurs of the darker excesses of sexuality.
